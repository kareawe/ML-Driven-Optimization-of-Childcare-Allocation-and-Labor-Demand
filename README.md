# ML-Driven Optimization of Childcare Allocation and Labor Demand 
This is the result of a project that utilized and applied public data related to childcare centers and labor (job opening, job search) to machine learning algorithms.    

This result was also applied to the "2024 National Happiness Service Discovery and Entrepreneurship Contest" hosted by the Korea Social Security Information Service and was selected as the final entry.

## Motivation
In a situation where orphanage leavers and those requiring guardians continue to experience economic difficulties, and in South Korea, where labor shortages are worsening as we enter a super-aging society, the introduction of a job matching system for orphanage leavers is an urgent task.

**Step 4. Analysis and visualization** </br>

- By looking at the visualized data, you can see which regions have a low labor demand ratio (Red and green areas represent high and low labor demand, respectively). </br>
- Therefore, population should be allocated to these regions first. </br>

**Step 5. Childcare facility matching**</br>

- Distance calculation </br>
- The figure below shows the step for calculating the distance between child care facilities and labor demand areas. </br>

- Ranking calculation </br>

- This figure shows ranking calculations based on distance and labor demand ratio.¬†Each cluster is ranked, which helps determine which areas should receive priority attention for employment placement. </br>
- The value in the ‚ÄúÎÖ∏ÎèôÏàòÏπò_Íµ∞Ïßë‚Äù column represents the unique number of each cluster, and the value in the ‚ÄúÎ∞∞Ïπò‚Äù column represents the rank in which each cluster will be assigned labor. For example, Cluster 0 ranks 81st to receive labor. </br>


**Final result** </br>
- The figure below is 3 childcare centers closest to cluster number 49 as an example. </br>
(The value in the ‚ÄúÎÖ∏ÎèôÏàòÏπò Íµ∞Ïßë Î≤àÌò∏, Î≥¥Ïú° ÏãúÏÑ§, Í±∞Î¶¨‚Äù column means Labor figures "Cluster number, childcare facilities, distance".) </br>

In the case of clustering, **K-Means Clustering** was used. For distance calculation, **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** was employed. Data preprocessing was conducted using job opening and job search data from each region.

- Labor Demand Ratio: This was calculated by dividing the number of job searches by the number of job openings. A lower value indicates a more severe labor supply shortage. <br>
- Required Workforce: This is an additional column added arbitrarily, representing the number of workers needed by subtracting the number of job searches from the number of job openings.
